# House Value Prediction with Decision Tree Regression

This repository contains code and resources for building a machine learning model to predict house values in Bangalore using Decision Tree Regression. In this README, you will find information on how to set up the environment, use the code, and interpret the results.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can predict the values of houses in Bangalore based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, etc. We will be using the Decision Tree Regression algorithm for this task, which is a powerful method for modeling non-linear relationships between features and target variables.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the "Bangalore House Price Prediction" dataset, which contains various features of houses in Bangalore and their corresponding prices. You can find the dataset [here](link_to_dataset). Make sure to download and place it in the `data` directory before running the code.

## Setup

To run the code in this repository, you will need to set up a Python environment with the required libraries. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-value-prediction.git
   cd house-value-prediction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```


3. Download the dataset and place it in the `data` directory.

## Usage

Once you have set up the environment, you can use the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to train the Decision Tree Regression model and make predictions.

### Jupyter Notebook

Open and run the `House_Value_Prediction.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to load the data, preprocess it, train the model, and make predictions.

### Python Script

Alternatively, you can run the Python script `house_value_prediction.py` from the command line:

```
python house_value_prediction.py
```

This script will load the dataset, preprocess it, train the Decision Tree Regression model, and save the model to a file. You can then use the model to make predictions on new data.

## Results

After running the code, you will have a trained model that can predict house values in Bangalore. You can evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2). The results and visualizations will be available in the Jupyter Notebook or as printed output from the Python script.
